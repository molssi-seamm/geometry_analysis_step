The Geometric Analysis plug-in provides the following functionality:

   #. Generating lists of all valence terms -- bonds, angles, dihedrals, and
      out-of-planes -- plus their value for the current structure. This functionality
      relies on the description of the bonds in the structure.
   #. Creating lists of terms and their values as specified in the input. Note that in
      this case the atoms do not need to be connected by bonds in the structure.
   #. Printing the tables of results to the output.
   #. Outputing the data to one or more tables.
   #. Storing the data in the internal SEAMM database.

The following sections cover accessing and controlling this functionality.
